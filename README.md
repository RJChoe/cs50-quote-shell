# CS50 Project: Quote Generator
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: ####

A CS50 project: a Python shell GUI that fetches and displays quotes containing a specific keyword from user input. Uses JSON data, ZenQuotes API, and NLTK for text processing.

## Features:
- Interactive shell interface for entering keywords  
- Different quotes returned for the same keyword each time  
- Filters quotes using NLTK to validate English words  
- Minimal API overhead with ZenQuotes JSON caching

_Example Usage:_<br>

```bash
python quote_shell.py
```

_Quote with exact word included:_ 

***time*** <br>
_("Don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.", 'Coco Chanel')_ <br>

```bash
python quote_shell.py
```

_Quote with exact word included:_

***time*** <br>
_('Mastery is not a function of genius or talent, it is a function of time and intense focus applied to a particular field of knowledge.', 'Robert Greene')_

## Tips for Users

- Best words for a variety of quotes: man, love, past

- Worst words/(categories): joy, death, (specific foods ex. coffee), (specific animals ex. penguin)

## Design Decisions:
<!-- if you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them -->

#### Virtual Environment
Included virtual environment instructions for accessability in README.md

Utilized Virtual Environtmnet:
- stable/reproduceable environment
- isolate dependencies between projects

#### User Input Validation
Utilized to enforce correct syntax (text/string input) and semantic value (English words).

- must be a string/text
- must be more than 2 letters
- must be a valid English word

#### NLTK Library
Utilized:
- tokenize to parse the user input keyword from quotes for efficiency/reduce error probability

- NTLK library to help filter English words from nonsense

#### User Input
Chose to allow users to type in their own keyword for search compared to a set category/genre/mood.

Pros:
- generate quotes from specific search word

Cons:
- difficult/unrefined validation compared to pre-set category/words

- limited quotes available at a time with the API utilized + the variety of user input words available create such a large scope that it limits successful quote generation

#### Zenquotes API
decided to use zenquotes API due to it's ability to cache a small JSON response of quotes on a changing/rotating basis for a wider variety of quotes with efficiency compared to large data sets

## Installation
Virtual Environment Setup:
utilize virtual environments to isolate dependencies

#### 1. Install Python
>[!NOTE]
>NLTK requires Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 or 3.11

[Official Python download documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


#### 2. Setting up Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment.

[Python Virtual Environment Guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments)

Before installing NLTK; [NLTK documentation for installation](https://www.nltk.org/install.html)

#### 3. Installing Dependencies
Activate virtual environment.


Unix/macOS:
```
source my_venv/bin/activate
```
Windows:
```
my_venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install project dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Dependencies Notes
Punkt tokenizer only needs to be downloaded once; **already implemented with download check in project.py code**

NLTK requires Punkt tokenizer:<br>
```
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```
